## Executive Summary

The Frito-Lay executive leadership team has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management.  However, before the business gives the green light on the project, it has been requested that we conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

This particular project is focused on two areas:  Attrition Classification and Prediction of Monthly Income.

The findings of this Analysis are below:
1. **Attrition**
  + Identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover
	+ Amount of Overtime
	+ Monthly Income
	+ Stock Option Level
  + Identify the job roles that experience the highest attrition
	+ Sales Representative
	+ Human Resources
	+ Laboratory Technician
  + Develop a model that will predict attrition
	+ KNN model was developed with Accuracy of .70, Sensitivity of 0.65, Specificity of 0.807
2. **Salary**
  + Develop a model that will predict salaries
	+ Multiple Linear Regression model was developed with an adjusted R-Square of 0.7997
